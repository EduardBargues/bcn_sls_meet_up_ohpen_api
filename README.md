## What was PST born for?

### Solve the major problems in the company

- Developers Spent most of their time integrating with other systems. Even the ones in the same company!
- Considering security slowed them down. Mainly VPC connections.
- They worked with environments manually maintained.
- The lack of standardization leat to confuse our clients.
- Security and architects team were repeating same security and compliance analysis over and over.

## Where did we want to go?

üë©‚Äçüç≥ Self service environments for our developers and clients.
1 environment per AWS account.
Must be secure.
Should be easy to use. If not, it will die!

IP whitelisting

## Easy to integrate with

Secrets manager and SSM parameter store that only the client can access.
