# What was PST born for?

## Ohpen was facing many problems

- Domain teams where exposing apis to clients in (too) many different ways.
- Each new client to onboard had different requirements.
- We had to ensure security and compliance over and over.
- Developers manually maintained their environments.

## The vision

- Self service environments for our developers.
- Automatic creation of environments and apis for our clients.
- Both must be secured the same way as in production.
- Must be easy to use and configure.

# üõ°Ô∏è Security

## Auth

- Mutual TLS using Custom Domain Names and AWS certificates manager.
- JWT based access using Cognito, Apigateway and Custom Lambda authorizer.

## IP filtering

IP whitelisting using WAF rules.

# üß∞ Easy integration

## Clients

- Secrets stored in Secrets Manager.
- Only accessible via resource policies and trusted IAM roles.
- Postman collections available.
- All our apis are [publicly documented](https://developer.ohpen.com).

## Developers

- Security first design. They develop exactly like in production.
- They can create/destroy environments and apis via pull requests.

# üëÄ Monitoring from day 0

## Compliance

We leverage AWS Config and Cloud Trail to track everything that happens.

## Costs

Creation of Datadog dashboards to monitor everything.

# How does it look?

## What are developers suposed to do?

# üëè Success!

## 100+ AWS accounts

## 250+ APIs publicly available

## Everything is 1 pull request away

# Thank you!
