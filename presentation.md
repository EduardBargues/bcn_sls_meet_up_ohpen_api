# Hello, I'm Eduard Bargu√©s

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/eduardbargues/), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eduardbargues/) and [eduardbargues.github.io](https://eduardbargues.github.io/).

I work at [Ohpen](https://ohpen.com) as Platform Owner together with a (small) group of incredible people:

- [Jozef Cajkovic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jozef-%C4%8Dajkovi%C4%8D-3389b644/) as Cloud Architect and Team Lead.

- [Matej Liner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matej-l%C3%ADner-8b283364/) as Cloud Architect.

# üë∂ The dawn of Platform Services Team

## Ohpen was facing many problems

- Domain teams where exposing apis to clients in (too) many different ways.
- Each new client to onboard had different requirements.
- We had to ensure security and compliance over and over.
- Developers manually maintained their environments.

## The vision

- Self service environments for our developers.
- On-demand environments and apis for our clients.
- Security first: Everything as in production by default.
- Must be easy to use and configure.

# üõ°Ô∏è Security

## Mutual TLS

Using Route53 public Hosted Zones, Custom Domain Names and AWS certificates manager. ![mtls](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EduardBargues/bcn_sls_meet_up_ohpen_api/main/images/mTLS.svg)

## JWT based access

Using Cognito, Apigateway, Custom Lambda authorizer and Dynamodb. ![jwt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EduardBargues/bcn_sls_meet_up_ohpen_api/main/images/jwt_access.svg)

## IP whitelisting

Using WAF rules and apigateway. ![waf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EduardBargues/bcn_sls_meet_up_ohpen_api/main/images/waf_ip.svg)

# üß∞ Easy integration

## Clients

#### Secrets stored in Secrets Manager

Only accessible via resource policies and trusted IAM roles.

![secrets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EduardBargues/bcn_sls_meet_up_ohpen_api/main/images/_secrets.svg)

#### All our apis are [publicly documented](https://developer.ohpen.com)

## Developers

- Security first approach. They develop exactly like in production.
- They can create/destroy environments and apis via pull requests.

# üëÄ Monitoring

- AWS Config for compliance analysis.
- Cost explorer for aggregated reports.
- Cloud Trail to monitor deployments.
- Cloud Watch for logging.

# How does it look?

## How does it work?
