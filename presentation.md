# üë∂ The dawn of the Platform Services Team

## We were facing many problems

- Domain teams where exposing APIs to clients in (too) many different ways.
- Each new client to onboard had different requirements.
- We had to ensure security and compliance over and over.
- Developers manually maintained their environments.

## The vision

- Self service environments for our developers.
- On-demand environments and apis for our clients.
- Security first: Everything as in production by default.
- Must be easy to use and configure.

# üõ°Ô∏è Security

## Mutual TLS

Using Route53 public Hosted Zones, Custom Domain Names and AWS certificates manager. ![mtls](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EduardBargues/bcn_sls_meet_up_ohpen_api/main/images/mTLS.svg)

## JWT based access

Using Cognito, Apigateway, Custom Lambda authorizer and Dynamodb. ![auth](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EduardBargues/bcn_sls_meet_up_ohpen_api/main/images/auth.svg)

## IP whitelisting

Using WAF rules and apigateway. ![waf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EduardBargues/bcn_sls_meet_up_ohpen_api/main/images/waf.svg)

# üß∞ Easy integration

## Clients

- Secrets stored in Secrets Manager
- Only accessible via resource policies and trusted IAM roles.
- All our apis are [publickly documented](https://developer.ohpen.com)

![secrets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EduardBargues/bcn_sls_meet_up_ohpen_api/main/images/_secrets.svg)

## Developers

- Security first approach. They develop exactly like in production.
- They can create/destroy environments and apis via pull requests.

![devops](https://www.websdirect.es/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Devops.jpg)

# üëÄ Monitoring

- AWS Config for compliance analysis.
- Cost explorer for aggregated reports.
- Cloud Trail to monitor deployments.
- Cloud Watch for logging.

# How does it look?

![main_diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EduardBargues/bcn_sls_meet_up_ohpen_api/main/images/main.svg)

# How does it work?

## Pull request to create a new environment

- An "empty" AWS account is created.
- Then, developers add features to it via json configuration.

```json
{
  "account_id": "74...9",
  "defaults": {...},
  "vpc": {...},
  "cloudmap": {...},
  "config": {...}
}
```
